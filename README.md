###### 
#### Description
Welcome to the NetSCAD Axis Guide! This tutorial covers the basics of defining and generating custom axes used in OpenSCAD, a solid 3D CAD modeler. This project aims to simplify the process of creating complex 3D models by providing reusable components and utilities. Currently, it includes automating the creation of custom Imperial and Metric axes. This allows for more precise modeling used in 3D printing.

#### Other NetSCAD Projects
If you're looking for custom object design and modeling tools, check out the NetSCAD-Tools repository.
* **NetSCAD-Tools:** [NetSCAD-Tools](https://github.com/ogmarveler/NetSCAD-Tools)
###### 
#### Prerequisites
* **You need to have the following installed:** [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html)
* **Download the latest release of NetSCAD-Axis:** [NetSCAD-Axis](https://github.com/ogmarveler/NetSCAD/releases/tag/netscad_01_1)
###### 
#### Types of Measurements
Varying axes of different sizes, measurement types, colors, and combinations of both metric and imperial measurements can be applied within the same SCAD project. Axes are managed in an aggregate SCAD file and are called as modules within your SCAD project. The app manages updates to existing axes as well as provides the ability for multiple axis types to be used in your project. Axis increments are as follows:
###### 
* **Metric axis** - 20mm, 10mm, 5mm, and 1mm increments
* **Imperial axis** - 1/4", 1/8", 1/16", and 1/32" increments
* **Convert mm to inches** - Enter inputs in Metric (mm) first, then select Imperial (in)
* **Convert inches to mm** - Enter inputs in Imperial (in) first, then select Metric (mm)
###### 
#### Layout of Custom Axes Builder
The Custom Axes Builder has 3 main visual sections: Custom Axes Builder, Generated Axes, and SCAD Output. The output of a newly created axis will show up below the SCAD Output. This shows the total cubic size, as well as the Calling Method to use within your OpenSCAD's project file. In the list to the right of the custom axis settings, you will see the newly created axis, along with axes that have been previously created. **Both ascending and descending sorting are possible, as well as sorting by multiple categories (shift + select).**

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:---------------------------------------:|:-------------:|
| 1. Open the **Axes** menu and select **Create New Axes**                      |                                         |               |
| 2. Select the **Unit Type**                                                   | Metric (mm) or Imperial (in)            | Metric (mm)   |
| 3. Select the **OpenSCAD** theme used in OpenSCAD                             | Light Theme or Dark Theme               | Light Theme   |
| 4. Enter numeric **Min X** value                                              | Min X **<=** 0 & Min X **<** Max X    | 0 (mm or in)  |
| 5. Enter numeric **Max X** value                                              | Max X **>=** 0 & Max X **>** Min X    | 300mm or 12"  |
| 6. Enter numeric **Min Y** value                                              | Min Y **<=** 0 & Min Y **<** Max Y    | 0 (mm or in)  |

#### Usage of Custom Axes in OpenSCAD
Axes are stored in a **Scad/Axes** folder that is included with the application. A **sample.scad** file is also included to provide a few examples of how to use the custom axes within your project. **The axes.scad and individual axis SCAD files within the Axes folder are NOT designed to be edited**, as they are managed by the application itself. Please understand if editing these files, it could break functionality of use of these files within the application itself.
###### 
* **Axes Module Name Format:** Get_ + { Theme } + { X Range } +  { Y Range } +  { Z Range } + { Unit Scale } + Origin + { Min X } + { Min Y } + { Min Z } (N = negative, i.e, N1 is -1)
###### 
| Files                           | Usage In Your SCAD File | Optional parameters |
| ------------------------------- |:-----------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Scad/Axes/axes.scad             | use <Axes/axes.scad>;   |                     |
| Scad/Axes/custom_axis_name.scad | Get_Custom_Axis_Name(); | colorVal, alpha     |
| Scad/sample.scad                |                         |                     |
